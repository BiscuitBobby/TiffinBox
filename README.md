# TiffinBox  

### Description  
TiffinBox is a simple, user-friendly desktop app that makes managing Distrobox containers a breeze. Think of it as Docker Desktop, but specifically for Distrobox. Instead of memorizing complicated commands, you can easily create and manage containers through a clean and intuitive interface. With Distrobox, you can run multiple Linux distributions on your system without the hassle of dual-booting or setting up virtual machines. Plus, the containers integrate smoothly with your host system, so you can share your HOME directory, access external storage, use USB devices, and even run graphical apps and audio just like they were installed natively.  

### Built with  
- **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS** for a snappy, modern frontend  
- **Rust** for a powerful and efficient backend  
- **Tauri** to wrap it all up as a lightweight desktop app  

### Why TiffinBox?  
Managing Distrobox containers through the command line can be a headache, especially if you don’t want to remember a ton of commands just to get things working. TiffinBox solves this by giving you an easy-to-use interface that makes container management as simple as a few clicks. Whether you’re a developer juggling multiple Linux environments or just curious to explore different distributions, TiffinBox takes away the complexity and lets you focus on what you actually want to do.
